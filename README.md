# emotion-recognition-with-Tensorflow

This is the emotion recognition project with TensorFlow 


## Project Set up and Installation

For the project, tensorflow, pandas, numpy, openCV  have to be installed.
The jupyter notebook is used for analyzing the dataset.



## Dataset 

I used [face emotion recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/rules) from kaggle 


## Script Files Used

1.`emotion_Recognition.py` is used for training the model  and `Emotion Recognition.ipynb` is to analyze the data and testing.

2.`Final_Output.py` is used for the final output testing with web cam.


## Results
Emotion recognition with Tensorflow gets need some parameter tuning and this is for
testing the tensorflow and some parameter tunings are still need.
